function [fn_out,fn_smwc] = hmri_proc_MPMsmooth(fn_wMPM, fn_mwTC, fn_TPM, fwhm, l_TC, pth_out)
% Applying tissue weighted smoothing, aka. weighted averaging, in order to 
% limit partial volume effect. 
% Since modulated warped tissue class images are also smoothed along the
% way, these are kept and could be used for standard VBM analysis
%
% This works on multiple parametric and tissue class maps from a *single*
% subject.

% FORMAT
%   [fn_out,fn_smwc] = hmri_proc_MPMsmooth(fn_wMPM, fn_mwTC, fn_TPM, fwhm)
% 
% INPUT
% - fn_wMPM : filenames (char array) of the warped MPM, i.e. the
%             w*MT/R1/R2s/A.nii files
% - fn_mwTC : filenames (char array) of the modulated warped tissue
%             classes, i.e. the mwc1/2*.nii files
% - fn_TPM  : filenames (char array) of the a priori tissue probability 
%             maps to use, matching those in fn_mwTC
% - fwhm    : width of smoothing kernel in mm [6 by def.]
% - l_TC    : explicit list of tissue classes used [1:nTC by def.]
% - pth_out : output path [empty by default -> same as input maps]
% 
% OUTPUT
% - fn_out  : cell array (one cell per MPM) of filenames (char array) of 
%             the "smoothed tissue specific MPMs".
% - fn_smwc : char array of smoothed modulated warped tissue classes.

%% NOTES:
% this works for one subject at a time, i.e. in the classic case of 4 MPMs 
% and GM/WM tissue classes take the 
% + 4 warped quantitative maps (in fn_wMPM) 
% + 2 modulated warped tissue class maps in fn_mwTC (e.g. mwc1*.nii and 
%   mwc2*.nii)
% + 2 TPMs matching the fn_mwTC
% 
% In the VBQ toolbox, one typically considers GM/WM to produce fin-images, 
% aka. fin_uni/dart_c1/2* images. The key word "uni"/"dart" come from
% either maps warped by unified segmentation only, or Dartel, respectively.
% On top of these 2, there was also a combined GM+WM fin-image created: 
% fin_uni/dart_bb* images -> I am skipping this for the moment. 
% 
% If different tissue classes were used then the explicit list of tissue 
% classes (l_TC) could come in handy to keep the numbering of resulting 
% images in line with their tissue class index.
% 
% In the _run function
% - the exact tissue class considered is defined by the index in the name
%   of the fn_mwTC files. So if mwc1*.nii and mwc2*.nii are passed, then
%   the 1st and 2nd tissue class are used from the TPM
% - Just pass the full name of the TPM, without subvolume index, the exact 
%   TC used is defined by the fn_mwTC
%
%% FUTURE:
% With present computer having large amounts of RAM, we could do most of
% the image calculation direction by loading the nifti files directly. This
% would eschew the use of spm_imcalc (and its annoying messages...) and
% likely be a bit faster. 
% Not sure how to perform the Gaussian smoothingn though. Probably some
% re-implementation could do the trick.

%% CHANGES:
% zero2nan call inside the loop
% applying pth_out for each new file
% p images are directly defined
% compute l_TC only -> faster
% explicit names for output: GM,WM instead of wap1,2 -> inputs are sorted
