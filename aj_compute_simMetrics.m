function [J, D, K] = aj_compute_simMetrics(Y1, Y2)
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Function to compute similarity metrics between two binary 3D matrices.
% This function computes three common similarity metrics used to assess the 
% overlap between two binary masks, typically in neuroimaging or other 
% biomedical contexts. The function calculates:
% 1. The Jaccard Index (J)
% 2. The Dice-Sørensen Coefficient (D)
% 3. Cohen's Kappa (K)
%
% These metrics compare the agreement between two binary 3D matrices, 
% which could represent regions of interest (ROIs), significant voxels, 
% or other binary data.
%
% The function assumes that the inputs `Y1` and `Y2` are binary 3D matrices 
% (e.g., derived from thresholded MPMs). 
% The output values provide measures of the overlap and agreement between 
% these matrices.

% INPUTS
% - Y1: A binary 3D matrix representing the first data set (e.g., a mask of 
%   significant voxels from the first map).
% - Y2: A binary 3D matrix representing the second data set (e.g., a mask 
%   of significant voxels from the second map).

% OUTPUTS
% - J: Jaccard Index, a measure of the similarity between the two binary masks 
%   defined as the ratio of the intersection to the union of the two sets.
% - D: Dice-Sørensen Coefficient, a measure of overlap between the two masks.
% - K: Cohen's Kappa, a measure of agreement between the two binary masks 
%   that accounts for chance agreement.

% PROCESS
% 1. The function first checks if the two input matrices `Y1` and `Y2` have the 
%    same size. If not, an error is raised.
% 2. It then thresholds the matrices to create binary masks (i.e., any non-zero 
%    values are considered significant).
% 3. The Jaccard Index is computed by dividing the number of overlapping significant 
%    voxels (intersection) by the total number of unique significant voxels (union) 
%    between the two masks.
% 4. The Dice-Sørensen Coefficient is calculated, which is a weighted measure 
%    of overlap that gives more importance to smaller values.
% 5. Cohen's Kappa is computed to assess the agreement between the two masks, 
%    taking into account the expected agreement by chance. The formula for Cohen's 
%    Kappa accounts for the probability of agreement by chance based on the 
%    proportions of significant voxels in each mask.
% 6. If any of the masks is empty (i.e., no significant voxels), warnings are 
%    generated, and the metrics are set to `NaN` (not a number), indicating that 
%    the metrics cannot be computed for empty masks.
